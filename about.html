	<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>HTML is a language of the web. It’s used to design the web pages or we can say structure the page layouts of a website. 
        HTML stands for HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE, as its full form suggests it’s not any programming language, a markup language. 
        So, while the execution of HTML code we can’t face any such error. 
        In real HTML code wasn’t compiled or interpreted because HTML code was rendered by the browser, 
        which is similar to the compilation of a program. Html content is parched through the browser to display the content of HTML.</p>

    <h1>HTML DOCUMENTS STRUCTURE</h1>

    <p>Html used predefined tags and attributes to tell the browser how to display content, means in which format, style, font size, and images to display. Html is a case insensitive language. Case insensitive means there is no difference in upper case and lower case ( capital and small letters) both treated as the same, for r example ‘D’ and ‘d’ both are the same here. </p>
    <h2>There are generally two types of tags in HTML: </h2>
    <p><b>Paired Tags:</b>These tags come in pairs. That is they have both opening(< >) and closing(</ >) tags.</p>
    <p><b>Empty Tags:</b> These tags do not require to be closed.</p>
    <p><b>Tags and attributes: </b> Tags are individuals of html structure, we have to open and close any tag with a forward slash like this. There are some variations with the tag some of them are self-closing tag which isn’t required to close and some are empty tag where we can add any attributes in it.  Attributes are additional properties of html tags that define the property of any html tags. i.e. width, height, controls, loops, input, and autoplay. These attributes also help us to store information in meta tags by using name, content, and type attributes.</p>

    <h2>Structure of an HTML Document</h2>
    <h3>An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts: </h3>
    <p><b> HEAD: </b>This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, the Title of the page, version of HTML, Meta Data, etc.<p>
    <p><b> BODY: </b>This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.</p>
